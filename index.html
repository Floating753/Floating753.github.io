                <h1>What is Water Scarcity?</h1>
                <p>Water scarcity refers to the shortage of available freshwater resources to meet the demands of human activities and ecosystems. It occurs when the demand for water exceeds the available supply in a specific area, or when poor water quality restricts its use.</p>
                <p>Water scarcity can be classified into two main types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physical Water Scarcity: This occurs when natural water resources cannot meet the area's demand. It is often due to over-extraction, dry climate, or inadequate infrastructure to access available water sources.</li>
                    <li>Economic Water Scarcity: This happens when water is available but inaccessible due to financial or institutional barriers, like lack of investment in water infrastructure or poor governance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Key factors contributing to water scarcity include population growth, climate change, urbanization, pollution, inefficient water use in agriculture, and poor water management practices.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>How it is affecting us?</h2>
                <p>Water scarcity has widespread impacts on human health, food security, economies, and the environment. Limited access to clean water leads to health issues, including waterborne diseases and poor sanitation. Agriculture, which heavily relies on water, faces reduced crop yields and rising food prices, contributing to food insecurity. Economically, industries suffer production slowdowns, and job losses occur in water-dependent sectors. Environmental degradation, such as the loss of biodiversity and desertification, is exacerbated by water shortages. Social and political tensions may arise as communities and nations compete for water, with migration often becoming a consequence. Climate change further worsens water scarcity through droughts, erratic rainfall, and the melting of glaciers, intensifying the global crisis.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>What will happen if no step is taken ?</h2>
                <p>If no action is taken to address water scarcity, it could lead to a global health crisis with increased waterborne diseases and preventable deaths. Agricultural output would decline, causing food shortages and rising prices, while key industries would suffer, leading to widespread unemployment and economic collapse. Environmental degradation would intensify, with the loss of ecosystems, biodiversity, and fertile land due to desertification. Social unrest and conflicts over dwindling water resources could arise, potentially resulting in wars and mass migration. Climate change would worsen, amplifying droughts and extreme weather, creating a vicious cycle of destruction and resource depletion.</p>
